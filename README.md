# Bow Drill

This is a fan-made, experimental mod for the game [The Long Dark](http://hinterlandgames.com/).

The goal of this mod is to give the player a new option for fire starting, a BowDrill that you can craft, this Bow Drill will be harder to use and take a little longer to start the fire, as you would expect.

### WARNING

This mod uses a modified version of the [ModComponent](https://github.com/WulfMarius/ModComponent) mod. This should not affect any other items that you have loaded using that mod, since I only enhanced it without changing how it works. I have submitted a PullRequest with my changes to the creator of that mod and as soon as he merges I will remove this warning.

### Disclaimer

* **DO NOT** report bugs to Hinterland Studios if you use this mod; any bug you encounter may be due to the mod.

* This is completely fan-made and I have **no affiliation** with Hinterland Studios whatsoever.

* This mod is **experimental**; it should work but there is no guarantee it won't screw up your save somehow (though corrupting a save is highly unlikely). It's also very rough in terms of use (you need to edit an XML file).

### How to install

* Install [zeobviouslyfakeacc's](https://github.com/zeobviouslyfakeacc) awesome [Mod Loader for TLD](https://github.com/zeobviouslyfakeacc/ModLoaderInstaller).

* The mod loader will create a directory 'mods' at the root of your game directory; it will also add a first mod: AddModdedToVersionString.dll. Leave it; it will make sure your game appears as loaded in the main menu.

* Extract the contents of the BowDrill.zip into the mods folder.

* The next time you start the game, the item should show up as something you can craft.

### How to use

### How to uninstall

To uninstall the mod, remove all the files in the mods folder.

If you want to completely remove modding capabilities from your game, use [zeobviouslyfakeacc's Mod Loader for TLD](https://github.com/zeobviouslyfakeacc/ModLoaderInstaller) again; you can disable the mod loading patch from the tool.
